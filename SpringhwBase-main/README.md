Based on Book Service, write a Chapter Service (I know it sounds weird), where:
1. book and chapter are 1-to-many mapping, meaning one book can have multiple chapters and one chapter can only belong to one book.
2. Chapter service support CRUD operations on chapters. e.g. POST <host>/book/book1/chapters will add a chapter to book1. The implementation should follow RESTFUL API design (http method, path, returned http code)
3. create correspongding Controller, Service, Dao for Chapter Service
4. In the DAO, think about a storage solution to store chapter information. You can probably user the same object for both BookDao and ChapterDao
5. Add proper validation and return proper error message
